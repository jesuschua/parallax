    <h2>Parallax Effect</h2>
    <p>This website is a demonstration of the parallax scrolling effect. There are many ways to achieve this. In this demo, it is done purely in CSS, and will work on all screens greater than 568 pixels.</p>
    <p>Parallax in common terms is the apparent faster movement of objects that are near the observer. The experience is similar to looking out of a moving vehicle's window. Fences just beside the road seem to pass at great speed, while mountains and farmlands at some distances away seem to move slowly, or not move at all.</p>

    <h2>Parallax in Websites</h2>
    <p>Websites achieve the parallax effect by having different scrolling behaviors for foreground and background content. The operative css property is "background-attachment: fixed". When applied to an image, the image's position is fixed and will not move even if the page is scrolled. The foreground content, on the other hand, is free to "float" and move on top of the background image. The difference in foreground and background movement is what the eye perceives as parallax.</p>

    <h2>On Mobile Browsers</h2>
    <p>Some browsers have a hard time handling parallax effects on small screens. Especially on mobile, it is customary to turn parallax effects off. In this demo, the parallax effect is disabled if the screen width is lower than 568 pixels.</p>
